    <p>
      Dave Congdon, owner and senior project manager, has 35+ yearsâ€™ experience in the construction industry. His experience is extremely valuable in providing preliminary budgets, constructability reviews, realistic schedules and valuable input and analysis of MEP and Structural Design team partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Westfork Construction was founded in 1995, seventeen years after Dave started his construction career. We have always specialized in design build projects and have provided a very comprehensive pre-construction service.
