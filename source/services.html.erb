      <h3>Construction Services</h3>
      <p>During the construction phase, West Fork Construction uses several different systems and practices to manage the project. For Instance, we use "Lean Construction Practices" to manage our projects and work closely with trade contractors to avoid conflicts, save costs, and shorten the construction period. In addition to the original milestone schedule, we use a 6-week look ahead schedule. At times when a high level of detail and coordination is required, a 3-week or even 1-week schedule is used. Communication is the key to an accelerated schedule. Weekly planning meetings are held with the trade contractors to review and discuss all work.
        <br>
        <br> To control the budget and keep the owner informed at all times, a Potential Change Order Log is kept current and reviewed with the ownerâ€™s representative. Throughout the entire process we work extensively with Trade Contractors to save cost and time on the project.
