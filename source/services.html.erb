      <h3>Construction Services</h3>
      <p>During the construction phase, West Fork Construction uses several different systems and practices to manage the project. In addition to the original milestone schedule, we use a 6-week look ahead schedule. At times when a high level of detail and coordination is required, a 3-week or even 1-week schedule is used. Communication is the key to an accelerated schedule. Weekly planning meetings are held with the trade contractors to review and discuss the work.
        <br>
        <br> To control the budget and keep the owner informed at all times, a Potential Change Order Log is kept current and reviewed with the ownerâ€™s representative. Throughout the entire process we work extensively with Trade Contractors to save cost and time on the project.
